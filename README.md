## Highlights
There are several features to this portfolio that I'm very proud of. 

- I enjoyed making my photo rounded. I love the way it looks even though I wanted a thumbnail.

- In the contact me section, I was able to make the phone number a link. This will be very valuable when viewing from a cell phone or any device that allows the user to call immediately. This allows the viewer to tap the number and call.

- In the contact me section, I was able to link my email address so when clicked on it, the viewer will go to their default email application to send an email. 

- It was great using the favicons for the bottom of the page.
