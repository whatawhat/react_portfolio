## Highlights
There are several features to this portfolio that I'm very proud of. 

- In the contact me section, I was able to make the phone number a link. This will be very valuable when viewing from a cell phone or any device that allows the user to call immediately. This allows the viewer to tap the number and call.

- In the contact me section, I was able to link my email address so when clicked on it, the viewer will go to their default email application to send an email. 

- I enjoyed making the cards and aligning them to be mobile responsive with clear buttons that link.

- The navigation bar will take the viewer to the appropriate section.

This is the view of the project cards in the mobile view. As you can see, the cards are in a column instead of a row.
