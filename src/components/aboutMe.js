                <p>
                I love puzzles. Some of my favorite puzzles include Sudoku, Killer Sudoku, and Samurai Sudoku. I enjoy jigsaw puzzles and even logic puzzles. My love for puzzles transfers to my career. I love challenges and enjoy problem solving and developing a solution or more if the problem calls for it.
                
                I teach students from a variety of levels who are blind or have a visual impairment. I collaborate with the educational team for each student. I hear problems from my fellow colleagues and have wanted to solve a new problem which led me to work towards becoming a web developer. I am very interested in web accessibility for everyone.
                    
                I apply my love for puzzles to help me grow and develop in the field of web development.
